# universal-file-handler contribution guidelines

## Crashes & Bugs

Log them in the [Issues](https://github.com/guesant/universal-file-handler/issues) tab.

Please keep in mind when reporting an issue:

- **Has it been reported?** Make sure an issue for the issue is not already there.
- **Has it been already fixed?** Make sure a fix wasn't already added.
- **Is it still relevant in the latest version?** Make sure to test it in the latest version.

If you do make an issue, Make sure to provide:

- A description of the bug/crash
- A summary of the steps to create the bug/crash
- A stack trace/logcat if possible, the longer the better.

If you have knowledge of React/JavaScript in general, you could also go about fixing the bug yourself and opening a [Pull Request](https://github.com/guesant/universal-file-handler/pulls).

## Feature Requests

These should also be logged in the [Issues](https://github.com/guesant/universal-file-handler/issues) tab.

Please keep in mind when requesting a feature:

- **Has it already been requested?** Make sure request for this feature is not already here.
- **Has it been already added?** Make sure this feature has not already been added in the most recent release.

If you do make a request, provide the following:

- What is it that you want?
- Is it related to some problem? If so, describe why.
- Why do you think it will benefit everyone's usage of the app?

If you have the knowledge, you can also implement the feature yourself and create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/guesant/universal-file-handler/pulls), but its recommended that **you create an issue beforehand to give me a heads up.**
Its also recommended that you read about [universal-file-handler Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md) as well to make changes better and more efficient.

## Translations

I still need to setup weblate, so currently you should open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/guesant/universal-file-handler/pulls) to add translations for your specific language.

## Code Contributions

If you have knowledge of React/JavaScript, feel free to to contribute to the project.

- If you want to help out with an existing bug report, comment on the issue that you want to fix saying that you are going to try your hand at it.
- If you want to add something, its recommended to open up an issue for what you want to change before you start working on it. That way I can determine if the addition will be merged in the first place, and generally gives a heads-up overall.
- Do not bring non-free software into the project, such as Binary Blobs.
- Please **_TEST_** your changes before creating a PR. Untested code will not be merged.
- Keep your code up the date with the upstream and continue to maintain it after you create the PR. This makes it less of a hassle to merge.
